## What is Windows Loader?
 
Windows Loader is a small utility that can load custom keys and certificates into the Windows registry and trick the system into thinking that it is activated by Microsoft. It can also modify some system files to remove the activation watermark and notifications.
 
Windows Loader was created by Daz, a well-known hacker and developer who has released several Windows activators and cracks over the years. The latest version of Windows Loader is v2.2.2, which was updated in 2023 and supports all versions of Windows from Vista to 10, as well as some server editions.
 
## How does Windows Loader work?
 
Windows Loader works by injecting a modified bootloader into the boot sector of your hard drive, which runs before Windows starts. This bootloader loads a custom System Licensed Internal Code (SLIC) into the memory, which is a digital certificate that authenticates the Windows license.
 
The SLIC emulates the BIOS of an OEM computer that comes pre-installed with Windows, such as Dell or HP. This way, Windows thinks that it is running on an OEM machine and does not require online activation.
 
Windows Loader also installs a custom key management service (KMS) emulator on your system, which can activate Windows using a generic volume license key (GVLK). This is useful for activating newer versions of Windows that do not have SLIC support, such as Windows 8 and 10.
