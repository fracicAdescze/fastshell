## Hamdard Medicines for Digestive Disorders
 
One of the most common health issues that people face today is digestive disorders, such as constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, gas, acidity, ulcers, and irritable bowel syndrome. These disorders can cause discomfort, pain, bloating, and affect the quality of life. Hamdard has a variety of medicines that can help improve digestion and relieve these symptoms.
 
One of the best-selling products for digestive disorders is Itrifal Ustukhuddus, which is a herbal laxative that cleanses the intestines and removes toxins from the body. It also helps regulate bowel movements and prevent constipation. Itrifal Ustukhuddus is made from natural ingredients such as ustukhuddus (lavender), anjeer (figs), behidana (quince seeds), and ghee (clarified butter). It is recommended to take one teaspoon of Itrifal Ustukhuddus at night before going to bed with lukewarm water or milk.
 
Another effective product for digestive disorders is Qurs Mulayyan, which is a tablet that acts as a mild laxative and carminative. It helps relieve constipation, gas, colic, and abdominal pain. Qurs Mulayyan is made from natural ingredients such as sana (senna leaves), haritaki (chebulic myrobalan), sajjikhar (sodium carbonate), and namak siyah (black salt). It is recommended to take one or two tablets of Qurs Mulayyan with water or milk in the morning or at night as needed.

Then I came across Hamdard's Itrifal Ustukhuddus and Qurs Mulayyan on the internet and decided to give them a try. I was amazed by the results. Within a few days, my digestion improved and I felt lighter and more energetic. I have been using these products regularly for over a month now and I have no complaints.
